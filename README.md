# Industrial Quality inspection System with ML

In this project, one of the most important points is detecting the product in the image which is taken by camera on the assembly line. Another important part is classifying the product to one of the classes “Accepted” or “Rejected” while the automation of visual quality control application for intelligent factory model is being performed. Object detection algorithm is carried out with machine learning algorithm.
